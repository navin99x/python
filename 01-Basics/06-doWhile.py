# python programming doesn't support do while loop statement but it can be aechived using while and break keyword

while True:
    user= int(input("Enter even number to terminate the program: "))
    if(user %2== 0): break

# here the while body will run atleast one time and the condition is checked at last similar to do..while loop statement.
